## Week: September 18th - 22nd**

### Word Chain Excercise
Excercise Tasks Worked On:
  - I worked on creating a small project plan to help document the responsibilities that each team member had
  - Allowed user input to be read into the code
  - Error handling (remove duplicates/same inputted word conflicts)
  - Verify when the word chain had finished
  - Cleaned up the code with some functions
  - Assisted in ensuring that the overall word chain ran as intended

Other Tasks Worked On:
  - Ensuring I had the opportunity to speak with every member of the team to communicate responsibilities + to receive/provide an update if needed
  - Assisting Mackenzie in scheduling what times the team should meet to discuss/work on the excercise.
