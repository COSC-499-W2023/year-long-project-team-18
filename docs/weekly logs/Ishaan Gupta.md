We finalized the features we are going to work on throughout the project. Created a rough timeline for when major milestones need to be completed. 
I worked on the project plan and decided what features I would be working on. I also wrote up the overview for our project which listed our Minimum Viable Product along with other things such as why users would want to use 
our software etc.

I worked on the error handling for the word chain program this week. I made sure that the user input was valid and fit the parameters of our 
program. If an invalid input was entered, whether that is for the initial word or the next word, the program would keep prompting the user to enter 
a valid word.
