<h1>Week Sept 18-24</h1>

Worked on the Word Chain exercise. 
Came up with the algorithm to replace the letter randomly in the user inputted word by using wildcards. 
I managed to find an API to get a package of words to cross-check the newly created word and make sure it is an English word that exists.
