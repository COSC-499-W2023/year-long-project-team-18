<h1>Week Nov 12 - Nov 26</h1>
<h1>Student Goals</h1>

* Getting familiar with the develop environment as I am joining it a little late. This is solely because I did more design work before approaching developing/coding
* Understanding how Kinesis works, working alongside Sam to implement features in that regard.
* Finishing up ER Design per feedback given in the presentation
* It is worth noting that I started the Database work with Segundo to try and figure out how to move forward. We initially used MySQL since we were familiar with it, however upon reaching a lot of complications, Segundo moved forward with MariaDB, and he is working on that himself.

<h1>Week Sept 18-24</h1>

Worked on the Word Chain exercise. 
Came up with the algorithm to replace the letter randomly in the user inputted word by using wildcards. 
I managed to find an API to get a package of words to cross-check the newly created word and make sure it is an English word that exists.
